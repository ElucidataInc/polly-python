It’s our annual event where we celebrate the hottest headliners in Life Sciences and Data Science. The overall theme of this year’s event is FAIR Data for Successful AI and thought-leaders across biopharma & biotech will be joining us to share their know-how and best practices while tackling challenges in adopting AI/ML.

The event will have 2 tracks -
- Data Centric AI
- FAIR Transformation

To join the conversation with over 1000 bio-enthusiasts from around the world on October 27th, register here, and reach out if you have any questions!
Here’re the Details:
- When: October 27th
- Time: 9 AM PST - 1:30 PM PST
- Where: Anywhere! This is a virtual event.

## Intended use of this space
This space is intended to help [polly-python](https://pypi.org/project/polly-python/) users for the following:-
- Resource sharing 
  - Collection of notebooks which help users with smooth onboarding to use polly-python. These notebooks can be opened directly on the Polly compute environment.
  - Publish case studies on topics similar to the biological questions which drug discovery teams are trying to answer.   
- Communicate directly with the product team 
  - Raise issue for any feature requests or bugs they encounter while using polly-python.
  - Discuss the key features being planned in polly-python product roadmap and provide feedback to team.

## How are the notebooks, issues and roadmap organized?
Most of the notebooks are organized as per the IDEATE Framework of Elucidata.

- **Ingest:** Enable users to bring their data as well as context to Polly. Context is as important as the data itself as it helps us to identify users' needs more accurately as well as it will help users to navigate Polly more efficiently.
- **Discover:** Enable users to search/query for datasets of their interest.
- **Enrich:** Enable users to enrich the data with public databases and navigate smoothly across the data from different sources.  
- **Analyse:** Enable users to build a collection of tools, notebooks, apps, and ML models used in bioinformatics.
- **communicaTE:**  Enable users to share the data, analysis, reports etc with colleagues to share and collaborate better.
